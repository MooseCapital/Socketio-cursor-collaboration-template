Anything outside of io.on('connection', (socket) => { } will persist
    - but once the user disconnects, any variables inside io.on are removed

cloudfare drops connections after 100 seconds of inactivity!
    - we can try to make some logic to disconnect users when they go to new tabs
    - and connect when they move back

we can pass data on connect with query's, such as
    - const myPublicKey = socket.handshake.query?.publicKey;
    - these can be used in middleware like JWT, so we can have auth like apis
    - this could be used to connect a user to a specific room

middleware is before the connection, so we can't listen for disconnection inside of it
